Hi guys to use that program first of all you should create one database in **Mssql** which name is **Beraberiz2** and copy the script from SqlScript folder and and execute it.
I'll keep adding new things on that projects when i get free time and my purpose on that program is managements and volunteer workers will be able to work in
coordination.Managements can create foods entries which they won't sell another day and volunteer works can see it and take it from management and deliver that food
to the shelters. For starting I wanted to create a desktop app.When i finish it i would like to move on mobile and web apps.
