Hi guys to use that program first of all you should create one database in **Mssql** which name is **Beraberiz2** and copy the script from SqlScript folder and execute it.
I'll keep adding new things on that project when i get free time and my purpose on that program is managements and volunteer workers will be able to work in
coordination.Managements can create food entries which they won't sell another day and volunteer workers can see it and take it from management to shelters to deliver that food. For starting I wanted to create a desktop app.When i finish it i would like to move on mobile and web apps.
