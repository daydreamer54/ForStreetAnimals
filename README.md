Hi guys to use that program first of all;


-You should create one database in **Mssql** which name is **Beraberiz2** and copy the script from SqlScript folder and execute it 


-After that you should create one connection between Visual Studio and Sql Server Management Studio to find the way of the project database 


-Then drag and drop tables into to my dataset which will be creating by Linq.ToSql.Class and write the way of the database into to app.config location.


I'll keep adding new things on that project when i get free time and my purpose on that program is managements and volunteer workers will be able to work in
coordination.Managements can create food entries which they won't sell another day and volunteer workers can see it and take it from management to shelters to deliver that food. For starting I wanted to create a desktop app.When i finish it i would like to move on mobile and web apps.
